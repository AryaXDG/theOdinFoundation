    <h1>I'm Learning CSS!</h1>
    <h2>first lets learn about the basic syntex</h2>
    <h3>Basic Syntax:</h3>

    <pre>
<code>
    selector {
        property : value;
    }
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Types of selectors:</h2>
    <h2>Universal(*):</h2>
    <p>This selector selects every type of element and apply rules that are written in the form of property and value pair </p>

    <h2>Type Selector(div/p/h2):</h2>
    <p>You can just put the name of the type as a selector and then follow the normal syntax</p>
    
    <h2>Class Selector</h2>
    <p class="highlight">We made a class here called highlight to make this this colour, this only applies to the element under this class</p>
    <p>This text is normal.</p>
    
    <h2>ID selectors</h2>
    <p id="myID">
    This a unique identifier which is kind of like a class but,
    The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID
    </p>

    <h2>Grouping Selectors</h2>
    <h3>we just write different elements and group them by comma (,)</h3>
